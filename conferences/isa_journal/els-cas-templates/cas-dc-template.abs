As a result of the increasing computing power with the quantum computing notion, it is predicted that the cryptosystems used today will not be reliable. Therefore, studies on cryptosystems that are reliable after quantum increased. The lattice-based systems become prominent in post-quantum cryptosystem design with their high-security level and small key sizes. The Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem proposed by Ajtai is known to be one of the difficult problems defined on lattice structures. Although several key exchange protocols based on the SIS problem have been proposed up to this time, these protocols have proven to be insecure against attacks. In this study, we present the CCA2 secure key encapsulation mechanism using the GUPTA encryption system based on the SIS and the non-homogeneous Short Integer Solution (ISIS) problems, presented in 2017. We then propose a new lattice-based key establishment protocol using the key encapsulation mechanism. Finally, we present a sample parameter set and a security analysis of the proposed protocol.
